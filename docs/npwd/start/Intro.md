:::warning

NPWD is still under heavy development and is **not ready** for use 
in live environments *just yet*! Breaking changes may be fairly frequent
as development progresses. **You should not install this phone for any other purpose
aside from beta testing**

:::

This is **New Phone Who Dis** a NUI based phone resource for the multiplayer GTA modification,
**FiveM**. This project was initially started by a group of ex-maintainers of the **GCPhone** project who
had become frustrated with the numerous issues that had started to grow in the legacy code.

There are several goals of this project: 
* Provide a **comprehensive** set of **features** not yet available on an open source phone
* Create a **clean** and **maintable** codebase
* Make it as framework **standalone** as possible
